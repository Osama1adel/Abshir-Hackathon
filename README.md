# Solution Hub – Abshir Hackathon Project

Solution Hub is an AI-powered platform designed to centralize and analyze user inquiries coming from multiple support channels.  
The goal is to reduce repetitive questions, speed up response time, and support employees with a unified, intelligent solution library.

## 🚩 Problem
Support teams often receive the same questions repeatedly across different channels (chat, social media, call centers).  
At the same time, users experience delayed responses and inconsistent answers.

---

## 💡 Solution
Solution Hub aggregates all user inquiries into a single platform where AI:
- Detects repeated questions using clustering
- Groups similar inquiries into one issue
- Generates draft solutions using AI
- Allows employees to approve solutions into a trusted knowledge base
- Automatically responds to users based on approved solutions

This creates a smart, reliable, and scalable support experience.
